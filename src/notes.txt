(Skills Section)

I am proficient in client-side languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and ReactJS in order to make dynamic 
and interactive user interfaces 

Additionally, I'm knowledgable in server-side technology such as MongoDB/Mongoose to create 
and interact with databases, as well as Express & NodeJS to handle network request and responses.

In addition to pure web development, I also have experience in design/marketing in which I 
learned graphic/UX design tools such as Figma for website protoyping and Canva for creating engaging
visuals.

I am also a self starter and enjoy taking the intitaitive of learning new/congruent skills on my own!
